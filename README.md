# About

- The project in question is an Android app, which utilizes the Finnish movie company Finnkino's open data. 
- It's My first attempt at implementing the MVVM pattern. Hence the project is organized into data, view, and viewmodel objects.
- The user can for example:
    - log in to the app and see which movies are presented in which theaters, and on which date.
    - search for movies by the name of an actor or director, genre, or name.
    - write small reviews for the movies and store the reviews for their viewing pleasure later.
    - create more than one user account.
